"""Tests for /home-free extracted-artifact paths in the signed audit chain.

On disk/memory cases VERDICT extracts artifacts to
``<case_home>/cases/<id>/extracted/disk/disk-extract-<id>/...`` and records that
ABSOLUTE path in each tool call's ``arguments`` (the replay-bearing dict). The
signed audit chain therefore leaks ``/home/<user>/...`` on a disk case, so a disk
case dir is not publicly committable. PR #77 relativized the provenance records
but not the per-tool-call ``*_path`` arguments.

``artifact_path`` (and its sibling ``*_path`` args) is operationally load-bearing:
the verifier replays a cited call by re-running the tool with its recorded
``arguments``. The fix records the path RELATIVE to ``case_home`` (portable,
reconstructable at both record and replay time) and resolves it back to the
absolute file at replay time, so the chain stays /home-free AND replay keeps
finding the file (``output_sha256`` matches).
