"""Finding-side contract: a finalized Finding keeps the signed chain /home-free.

ROUND 1 (PR #92) relativized the per-tool-call ``*_path`` arguments + the
``extra["artifact_path"]`` display copy at ``_record_tool``. But a live SCHARDT.dd
re-run showed the leak persists in the FINDINGS themselves: on disk/memory cases
each Finding records the operator's extracted-artifact ABSOLUTE path in two places
the signed chain then leaks:

- ``Finding.artifact_path`` (echoed into the ``finding_approved`` audit record
  ``.payload.finding.artifact_path`` AND ``verdict.json .findings[].artifact_path``)
- ``Finding.description`` free text that embeds that same absolute path.

``relativize_finding_paths`` is the finding-side mirror of the ROUND 1 record-side
fix: it relativizes the finding's ``artifact_path`` to ``cases/<id>/extracted/...``
(the same ``case_home`` anchor / same helper) AND rewrites any verbatim occurrence
of that original absolute path inside the description to its relative form, so both
the field and the prose go /home-free in one place.

``Finding.artifact_path`` is display / citation metadata, NOT replay-bearing: the
verifier replays a finding by re-running its cited ``tool_call_id`` (the recorded
``arguments`` ROUND 1 already relativizes + resolves on replay), never by opening
``finding.artifact_path``. The one place it is read is the opt-in re-bind gate
(``FIND_EVIL_REQUIRE_ARTIFACT_REBIND=1``), which compares it to the cited call's
RECORDED (already-relativized) ``*_path`` by basename OR full-path equality — so a
relativized finding ``artifact_path`` still matches (basename unchanged; full path
now matches the relativized record too). Hence a PLAIN relativize is correct: no
resolve-on-read is needed, unlike the tool_call replay path.

These tests pin:

- F1: an extracted-style absolute ``artifact_path`` is recorded /home-free and
      relative, and the SAME path embedded in the description is rewritten too.
- F2: a forensic in-image path in the description (e.g. ``C:\\...`` or a deleted
      file path) that is NOT the finding's operator artifact_path is left untouched
      (no blind /home-or-path scrub that would mangle forensic text).
- F3: a ``/evidence/`` single-file finding is unaffected (its artifact_path is not
      under case_home, so it survives verbatim, and its description is untouched).
