"""Portable, /home-free recording of extracted-artifact paths in the audit chain.

On disk/memory cases VERDICT extracts artifacts under
``<case_home>/cases/<id>/extracted/...`` and records that ABSOLUTE path in each
tool call's ``arguments`` (the replay-bearing dict). Recorded verbatim, the signed
audit chain then leaks ``/home/<user>/...`` and a disk case dir cannot be publicly
committed.

The ``*_path`` arguments are operationally load-bearing: the verifier replays a
cited call by re-running the tool with its recorded ``arguments``. So the recorded
value must be /home-free AND still resolvable at replay time. The portable anchor
is ``case_home`` (``$FINDEVIL_HOME`` else ``$HOME/.findevil`` — see
:func:`resolve_case_home`), which is reconstructable identically at record and
replay time. An extracted path is recorded RELATIVE to ``case_home``
(``cases/<id>/extracted/...``) and resolved back to absolute before replay.

Only paths genuinely under ``case_home`` are rewritten. ``/evidence/`` source
paths and any other absolute path pass through untouched — relativizing them would
either leak nothing (already /home-free) or break replay (no resolvable anchor).
