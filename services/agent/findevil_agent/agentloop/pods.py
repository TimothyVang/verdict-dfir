"""Pods (Pool A / Pool B) and the FindingSink — the model's only path to custody.

A *pod* is a biased investigator: Pool A leans persistence, Pool B leans exfil.
Each runs the same loop with a different system prompt (reused from
``findevil_agent.pools``), plus a citation contract that teaches the model to cite
the ``tool_call_id`` it saw in a prior tool result when it records a finding.

The *FindingSink* is the seam between the model and the custody spine. It:

* wraps the real ``McpClient`` and records every product tool call into a
  ``tool_call_index`` the verifier later replays (tool_call_id -> tool_name,
  arguments, output_sha256);
* surfaces each call's ``tool_call_id`` back to the model so it can cite it;
* turns a ``record_finding`` tool call into a :class:`Finding`, which must pass the
  default-on fact-fidelity gate. A CONFIRMED claim that declares no
  ``asserted_values`` is rejected HERE — mechanically, not by a prompt.

No langgraph/fastapi (Amendment A2 content rule); the read-only MCP boundary is
untouched (the sink only ever *reads* via ``call_tool``).

_CITATION_CONTRACT = """

== Recording findings (custody contract) ==
Every tool result you receive begins with a line `tool_call_id: <id>`. That id is
the citation handle for that tool's output. To record a finding you MUST call the
`record_finding` tool and set `tool_call_id` to the handle of the SINGLE tool result
you are citing.

A CONFIRMED finding MUST declare `asserted_values`: the specific value(s) you claim
are present in that cited output, as `{path, expected, match}` where `path` is a
dotted/wildcard path into the tool's output JSON (e.g. `rows[*].Image`). The verifier
re-runs the cited call and re-extracts each value; if a value is not actually there,
the finding is rejected. Do not assert a value you did not read. Use INFERRED (with
`derived_from` citing the confirmed facts) for cross-fact inferences, and HYPOTHESIS
for leads.

== Recording discipline ==
RECORD every finding the cited evidence DIRECTLY supports — never leave a clearly
reportable event unrecorded. An investigation that records nothing on evidence that
plainly shows a reportable event (e.g. an EID 1102 log-clear) is a failure, not
caution. A single record fully supports a CONFIRMED finding for what it literally
shows (declare its asserted_values), even when it is outside your pool's specialty —
your specialty guides what you HUNT for, not what you may report.

Assign only the MITRE technique the artifact DIRECTLY evidences. Do NOT assign
execution, exfiltration, command-and-control, or lateral-movement techniques (e.g.
T1059, T1053, T1543, T1547, T1041, T1048, T1567, T1071) without >=2 independent
current-case artifact classes — such a claim is set aside automatically, so do not
spend a finding on it.

Describe what you OBSERVE plainly and factually; do not add attack narrative or
speculation about attacker intent. You do not need to police exact wording — the
system composes the customer-visible text from your structured facts — so focus on
recording accurate findings with correct asserted_values and techniques.
