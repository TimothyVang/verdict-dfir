"""``verify_finding`` tool — re-run a Finding's cited tool call.

Wraps :func:`findevil_agent.verifier.reverify_finding`. The wrapper
spawns its own short-lived stdio connection to ``findevil-mcp`` (the
Rust DFIR tool server) so the re-execution path is byte-for-byte
identical to what the original agent saw — same binary, same args,
same SHA-256.

Returns the verifier action ('approved' / 'rejected' / 'downgraded')
plus a replay record describing the comparison.

The Rust binary is spawned as a child process for each call. That's
not the cheapest possible path, but it's the cleanest — the
verifier is intentionally a deliberation step (Spec #2 §8.1 budgets
30s/finding), not a hot loop, and a fresh subprocess avoids any
state leak between findings.
