"""divergence-smoke - assert CLAUDE.md "Spec/code divergences" stay
downstream-clean.

CLAUDE.md documents 8 spec/code divergence sections; 6 currently
have executable wrong-pattern checks. The previous 11 iterations of
doc-vs-code audits caught 25 stale references where the "wrong" half
of a divergence had survived in active files.
Three iterations of the divergence-sweep procedure (commits
782f364, e6ddc2d, fb319dd) cleaned the active surface area; this
smoke locks the cleanup so a future contributor can't silently
re-introduce one of the bad shapes.

For each divergence with an executable wrong-pattern, this smoke
scans active files for that pattern and FAILs if it appears
outside an allow-list. The allow-list is intentionally narrow:
historical specs/plans + CHANGELOG entries describing the
historical bug + the deliberately-commented marker line.

Wall-clock: ~30ms. Wired into docker/l1-compose.yml after
launcher-smoke as the 7th L1 smoke.

The divergences (matching CLAUDE.md "Spec/code divergences"):

  §1  Rust 1.83 -> 1.88                bad: rust:1.83-bookworm
  §2  Cargo.lock committed             declarative; nothing to scan
  §3  findevil_agent.cli dropped (A2)  bad: python -m findevil_agent.cli
  §4  Rust MCP tool count is 31        bad: stale 11/12/20 Rust or 32-tool count
  §5  rmcp not a runtime dep           bad: live `rmcp = "=...` (uncommented)
  §7  A3 MemoryStore phrase-quote      doc-only; no shipped wrong-pattern
  §8  A3 audit push: SSE not WebSocket bad: "ws": "..." dep in apps/web pkg
